# factory managment - server

Hi!
This project is actually my first experience with python.

# Description
An end to end application for factory management, including editing employees, shifts, and departments

# Login

The users who are allowed to connect to the site using a username and email are brought from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users


# Server - Python (Flask, pymongo, JWT)
# client - JavaScript (vanilla js)
# Database - MongoDB (studio3T)


# My Experience
when i wrote this project, i felt like i am getting better with my logic thinking, data manipulation and my understanding with all server and client relationship.
There were a lot of things I learned along the way, and without a doubt, it improved me and made me enjoy the process even more
